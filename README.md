A responsive web app coordinating all things meal related for Taos Co-Op (Austin, TX).

## The purpose of this project is to:

1. Develop a functional, mobile-first web-app for the Taos Co-Op in Austin, TX

Today I created a [rough sketch of the UI](https://github.com/dominicgaliano/taos-menu-planner-website/blob/main/Taos%20Menu%20Planner%20Website%20Rough%20UI%20Design.pdf) that I plan to implement for this project. The design is meant to be simplistic and easy to use. My goal is for the main functionality to be accessible without needing to login or navigate to any pages other than the index.

Today I began the process of creating the Taos menu planner website. My first plan of action was to outline some personal goals and menu planner goals that I hope to achieve throughout the implementation of this project. I also created a list of essential, desired, and stretch components for the project. The first day of classes is Jan 9th, so I plan to start by creating an MVP using just the essential components with frontend styling.
